# WORKTREE — bionic 1.4.0 wave, slice WORKTREE (spec AC-11, AC-28; design ledger
# C1 "worktree lease", C2 ".bionic symlink retired").
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE OWNS. One payload library:
#
#   payload/scripts/lib/worktree.sh   the lease: land, legacy links, overruns
#
# WHY A LIBRARY AND NOT THE SCRIPT. Three callers need the same three answers —
# `spawn-worktree.sh land`, `hooks/stop-orders.sh standdown`, and the Patrol
# tick's lease-overrun line. A copy in each is three definitions of "discharged"
# and three definitions of "a suite is running", which is the divergence class
# this repo keeps paying for. The verb in spawn-worktree.sh is a two-line call
# site; the behaviour is here, and so are its tests.
#
# HERMETIC. No network, no `claude` CLI, no contact with the bionic checkout
# this suite runs inside beyond sourcing the library under test. Every git
# command is `-C <fixture>` or inside a subshell that has cd'd into one; global
# and system git config are pointed at /dev/null. The session files the D1
# predicate reads come from a fixture claude-home reached through
# BIONIC_CLAUDE_HOME — the knob payload/scripts/lib/patrol.sh already uses for
# exactly this directory, so there is one override chain and not two.
#
# THE SUITE-RUNNING ARM STARTS ITS OWN PROCESS. D1 is a conjunction: a busy
# session in this project AND a live `tests/run.sh`. This suite is itself run BY
# tests/run.sh, so the process half is ambient-true there and ambient-false
# standalone. A test that relied on the ambient answer would pass for a
# different reason in each mode, so the positive arm spawns a real script at
# <fixture>/tests/run.sh and the negative arms turn the session half off.
#
# BOTH ARMS, ALWAYS. Every refusal is asserted against the matching acceptance.
#
# Usage: bash tests/worktree.test.sh
